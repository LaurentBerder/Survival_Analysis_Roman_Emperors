This paper is a survival analysis based on Roman Emperors (from 26 before JC to 395 AD), for which data was found on this website: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/roman-emperors/table/?sort=index

I've investigated on the individual factors that could explain survival likelihood for the emperors over time.
In this study, Assassination, Captivity and Execution are considered as traumatic ends to their reigns (event = 1), while Natural Causes, Died in Battle and Suicide are more "normal" ways for an emperor's reign to come to an end (event = 0). Censoring took place for emperors who died after the end of their reign (the ones that abdicated or were deposed without being killed)
